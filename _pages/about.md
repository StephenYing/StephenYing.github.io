## Hi there, I am **Qizhen (ÂêØÁ•Ø)** üëã

I am currently an MSc student in Advanced Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) ([Exeter College](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk)), and next year I will begin my DPhil in Engineering Science. Before that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), where I was privileged to conduct ML research under the guidance of [Dr. Song Liu](https://allmodelsarewrong.net/).

I‚Äôm passionate about building efficient generative methods that can adapt to a variety of scenarios. I envision that effective and stable generative techniques can help us augment reliable synthetic samples to overcome data scarcity challenges.

**Research interests:** Statistical ML (particularly generative models), Reinforcement Learning  
**Contact:** [qizhen.ying@exeter.ox.ac.uk](mailto:qizhen.ying@exeter.ox.ac.uk)  

I am **open to opportunities** and collaborations. If you‚Äôd like to work together, please feel free to get in touch!
